ShotTracker
===========

Open source gun shot detection.

My family lives in a distressed neighborhood. We like it there intentionally and don't want to leave.

I am increasingly sick of waking up in the middle of the night taking my family to a back room and calling the cops. An officer is sent to check things out nothing ever happens. Some cities has purchased expensive software to trianglate gun shot locations and notifiy police. The effectiveness of this has been questioned because of false positives and lack of cameras to get leads. There doesn't seem to be an open source software/hardware solution that small communties or just a group of neighbors could cheaply implement and manage themselves.

The goals of this project are.

- Detect a Gun shot event.
- Take series of panaramic pictures for a sensable duration of time.
- Post data to webserice that could then triangulate location based other devices reporting in your area and push out notifications.

I imagine this will be an arduino project, but would love suggestions.
