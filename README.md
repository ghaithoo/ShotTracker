ShotTracker
===========

Open source gun shot detection and localization.

## Background

My family lives in a distressed neighborhood. We live there intentionally and don't want to move. I am increasingly sick of waking up in the middle of the night to gunfire, taking my family to a back room and calling the cops. An officer is sent to check things out nothing ever happens. Some cities have purchased expensive software to trianglate gun shot locations and notifiy police. The effectiveness of this has been questioned because of false positives and lack of cameras to get leads. There doesn't seem to be an open source software/hardware solution that small communties or just a group of neighbors could cheaply implement and manage themselves.

## Goals

- Detect a Gun shot event.
- Take series of pictures in the direction of the shot for a sensable duration of time.
- Post data to webservice that could then triangulate location based other devices reporting in your area and push out notifications.

## Contributing

Feedback on the overall direction of the project would be appreciated. I have created issues for choosing a platform and finalizing project goals. Discussions in those would be helpful.
